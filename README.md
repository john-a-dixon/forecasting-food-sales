# Forecasting Food Sales

_John Andrew Dixon_

## Overview

The goal is to analyze past sales data to find relationships that can hopefully optimize an outlet's future sales and help them make better financial choices.

## Insights

The primary insights garnered from my analysis deal with outlet location, outlet type and their corresponding sales.

### Outlet Location & Sales

The bar graph below shows that location correlates with sales. It's not that location choise causes better sales though I can say that if an outlet chooses a location of **Tier 2** they _may_ likely have better sales.
